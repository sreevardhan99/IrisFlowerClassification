# Iris Flower Classification

<img src="https://miro.medium.com/max/875/1*7bnLKsChXq94QjtAiRn40w.png">

This project uses Python programming in conjunction with machine learning.
It focuses on classifying IRIS flowers using machine learning and Scikit-Learn techniques. 
Several machine learning algorithms, including supervised and unsupervised learning methods, are employed here.
The following algorithms are used to predict and obtain accuracy:

1. Decision tree classifier 
2. K closest classifier
3. SVM
4. The Logistic Regression Model 
5. Quantification
6. split_train_test
In the Iris project, we are using the Iris Dataset to make predictions and with accuracy.
For those who are new to machine learning, this is simple and predictable.

PS: If you enjoy it, don't forget to give it a star!
